# MeaningAware — The Meaning Physics Layer

**MeaningAware** is a lightweight semantic-resonance engine that makes *meaning itself computable*.  
Built to run on any device — even a 5-year-old consumer laptop — it performs real-time bias analysis,  
emergence detection, resonance mapping, meaning fingerprinting, and multi-modal interpretation.

It is the **missing physics layer for AI**, and the semantic foundation for:
- **Cohereon** (pattern-learning, coaching, multi-modal inner growth)
- **Voice+** (trace-based direct democracy & civic meaning audit)
- **Meaning-Aware Economy** (resonance-based value & trust metrics)

This repository hosts the public website (`index.html`) and documentation for the MeaningAware project.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities (Live Today)

### **1. Real-Time Bias & Omission Scan**  
12-dimension bias vector + structural omissions — computed in **< 100 µs**.

### **2. Emergence Detection**  
Detects meanings *not present in text*, but created through perception (e.g., A1 + A3 + Context → AE*).

### **3. Multi-Perspective Meaning Field**  
Projects concepts into a resonant field across CH / US / Global or custom profiles.

### **4. Meaning Fingerprint (256-bit)**  
Cryptographic semantic fingerprint for every output (R-value, ΔΦ, omissions, resonance path).

### **5. Multi-Agent Debate Engine**  
Neutral perspective-moderation across conflicting biases.

### **6. Truth-Shift Simulator**  
Small semantic changes → measurable resonance effects.

### **7. Meaning-Aware Economy Metrics**  
Ranking by net-positive resonance contribution.

### **8. Semantic Quantum Machine (SQM)**  
Underlying architectural layer: superposition → collapse → resonant shift.

### **9. Multi-Modal Interpretation Layer**  
Integrated with **Cohereon** learning patterns and psychological axes, enabling AI to:
- Read text, image, narrative, and state-changes through a single resonance model.  
- Map inner-growth journeys, coaching flows, experience traces, and archetypal biases.  
- Produce cross-modal meaning consistency (text ↔ behaviour ↔ decision patterns).

## 🏛 MeaningAware + Democracy (HV)
MeaningAware is also the semantic backbone of **Voice+**, enabling:
- Traceable framing of public debate
- Explicit omissions (what was NOT said)
- Multi-group resonance analysis (citizens, experts, institutions)
- Fairness-aligned decision fields for direct democracy
- Verifiable meaning dynamics behind policy proposals

It allows a society to inspect:  
**“What does this message *do* to different groups?”** — instead of *“Do we agree?”*
